        <p>Hey Hottie,</p>
        <p>You always make me laugh and smile, even from miles away. I miss our silly moments and your cute sense of humor. I built this website because why the fuck not, and also to remind you how much I LOVE you. Thinking about all the fun we'll have when we're together again. And cream pies. Until then, stay amazing and keep making me smile.</p>
